# Solving the coding challenge

## Setup
* create gitlab repo with given files as baseline
* run `dotnet build` to create bin and obj dirs
* add those dirs to `.gitignore`
* run `dotnet test` to make sure tests work.
* check out tests, and overall structure of code
   * MVC structure
   * Given tests are pretty sparse, but this is just a coding challenge, not production ready
